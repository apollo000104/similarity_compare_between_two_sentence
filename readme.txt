hello,
this is a code for getting similarity score of two labels in your datasets.
I mean the excels and final excel.

okay.

this is final labels in your final excel.

and these are labels in your old excel,, ---database


okay?


then I will try it.


it will show your the most similar labels.


for example
Unit:   ['Post Handover Months Number', 'Status']   Post Handover Months Number

this means that Unit is simialr to each elements of ['Post Handover Months Number', 'Status'] and finally most similar 'Post Handover Months Number'

But as you can see, it is not similar in real world, so in that case I will not exchange Unit as the other.
I mean, odd it .

But look:
Status:   ['Handover Date', 'Post Handover Months Number', 'Status']   Status

here you can see status is similar to status.
It means my code works well.
okay?

look another output for that.
Price:   ['Min Price AED', 'Max Price AED', 'Max Size SQF', 'Handover Date']   Max Price AED


here , 'Price' in Old excel is similar to  ['Min Price AED', 'Max Price AED', 'Max Size SQF', 'Handover Date'] and my choice is  'Max Price AED'.

It looks good with real world concepts.

this is my result.


So from now, I will make the code for all of excel files in your database.

And using it, I will exchange labels in database with labels in final excel file.


it is my purpose..good.


then, I will merge all files using pandas library.

after that, you will get one file which you want to get.

thanks for you time~~~
